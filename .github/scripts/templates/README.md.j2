Welcome to my container images, if looking for a container start by [browsing the GitHub Packages page for this repo's packages](https://github.com/virtualdisk?tab=packages&repo_name=containers).

## Purpose

Sometimes an upstream container does not have certain configurations or binaries I need to use within my home infrastrucutre. This repository provides a way for me to automatically build and update my own containers based off of upstream images.
These containers are subject to change at any time, but you are free to use them.

## Available Images

Each Image will be built with a `rolling` tag, along with tags specific to it's version. Available Images Below

Container | Channel | Image
--- | --- | ---
{% for image in app_images | sort(attribute="name") -%}
[{{ image.name }}]({{ image.html_url }}) | {{ image.channel }} | ghcr.io/{{ image.owner }}/{{ image.name }}
{% endfor %}

## Deprecations

The availability of these containers are subject to change at *ANY POINT* without warning. For a project better intended for public consumption, check out [onedr0p's containers project](https://github.com/onedr0p/containers), which is what this repo is based on.

## Credits

A lot of inspiration and ideas are thanks to the hard work of [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) contributors and [onedr0p](https://github.com/onedr0p).
